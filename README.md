# What is this game?

Welcome to Spider Mansion, a horror puzzle game where you take on the role of a
nanny tasked with caring for a young girl named Eva. Brace yourself for a series
of lateral thinking puzzles!

# How we started

One of our teammates had the interesting idea of adapting lateral thinking
puzzles into horror visual-novel game. These puzzles typically require
discussion with another person to solve. We decided to collaborate with a
technology student with a strong interest in AI, which led us to the idea of
incorporating AI into the puzzle itself.

Instead of simply creating an emotional NPC with AI, we're training the AI to
focus on the puzzle's narrative, essentially turning this human interaction
requirement into the core gameplay mechanic.

Visually, the game will have an early 2000s horror RPG aesthetic, contrasting
with the modern twist of using an AI communication system as the main gameplay
mechanic.

# Why you should play it
